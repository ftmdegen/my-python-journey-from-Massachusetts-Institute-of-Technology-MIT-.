# MIT 6.0001 - Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python

My exercises and solutions from MIT's Introduction to Computer Science and Programming using Python course.

## About This Repository

This repo contains my finger exercises, problem sets, and notes as I work through MIT's 6.0001 course. 
I'm documenting my learning journey to:
- Track my progress
- Build my portfolio
- Help others learning Python
- Review concepts later

## Course Information

- Course: MIT 6.0001 - Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python
- Platform: MIT OpenCourseWare
- Started: 4th of December, 2025
- Status: In Progress

## 📖 Progress

### Completed Lectures
- [x] Lecture 1: Introduction to Python
- [ ] Lecture 2: (Coming soon)
- [ ] Lecture 3: (Coming soon)

### Finger Exercises Completed
- [x] Lecture 1: Largest Odd Number Finder

## Technologies

- Language: Python 3.x
- IDE: VS Code, PyCharm
- OS: Windows

## 📝 How to Use

Each lecture folder contains:
- `README.md` - Exercise descriptions and my approach
- `.py` files - Solution code with comments
- `notes.md` - Key concepts learned

To run any exercise:
```bash
cd Lecture-1
python finger_exercise_1.py
```

##  Key Learnings

### Lecture 1
- Brief history of computers and it functions
- Variables and data type
- Syntax, semantics, static semantics
- Lists and basic operations
- Modulo operator for checking odd/even numbers

##  Learning Approach

1. Understand the problem - Write pseudocode/recipe
2. Break it down - Identify steps needed
3. Code incrementally - Build feature by feature
4. Test thoroughly - Try different inputs
5. Document - Add comments and explanations
6. All about first principles thinking
